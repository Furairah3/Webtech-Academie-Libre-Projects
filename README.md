# Webtech-Academie-Libre-Projects
Académie Libre is the first online platform in Niger built exclusively for candidats libres, combining past exam papers, interactive quizzes, and AI-powered feedback — all in one place. Unlike other resources, we don’t just give study materials, we provide guidance and motivation like a virtual teacher.
